### Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?

I wanted to do a children's book for this assignment because most children's picture books are about 500 words. I chose Madeline. I found a font close to the title font on "Madeline" using the app WhatTheFont. It's called "KTF Roadbrush". I chose a serif font called "Crimson Text" for the body text because it is highly readable and reminescent of children's literature. The background is the yellow that the Madeline books use. I painted the vines, edited it in Photoshop, and included it in the background of the website as a PNG.

### What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

A system font is a font included with your operating system. A web font is a font that is hosted online and embedded into your HTML and CSS files. A web-safe font is font that most browsers support regardless of your operating system. It is important to have fallback fonts for your font choice so that you can control what font users see if your font fails on their browser.
