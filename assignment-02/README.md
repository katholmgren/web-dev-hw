# Assignment 2

## Katherine Holmgren

I am taking this class because it is required for the Media Arts BA. I would take it anyway, though, because I'm very interested in web development and design.

I would like to learn CSS and HTML. I would like to learn how other programming languages contribute to the interactivity of a website. I would also like to learn resources that I can go to to continue my learning after this course.

I've enjoyed learning about how the Internet works! It is a good thing to know and I wouldn't try to learn it on my own time.
