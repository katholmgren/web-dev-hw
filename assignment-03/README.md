## Browsers

A browser is a software that allows a user to access the Internet. Browsers take HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to display documents on the web. Browsers have a user interface, a rendering engine (displays the visual elements of a page), and a browser engine (connects user interface, rendering engine, and servers). Browsers are connected to the network to receive the files that make up a web page.

I use Google Chrome on my laptop and Safari on my smartphone.
