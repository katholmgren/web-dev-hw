### Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Divs provide structure to the html document. You can style each div how you choose by giving them an id and class. Spans have the same function as divs but they are inline, meaning there will not be a line break like a div. ID's bring identity to a specific html element. This can be useful for styling individual elements. Any element can have an ID. Classes are used for identifying multiple elements for styling and organizational purposes.

### What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt text is used for people who are using screen readers and can't see an image. It is also used for people who are using out-of-date browsers that won't support embedded media. Including alt text brings clarity for these users.

### Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I couldn't choose my absolute favorite song, so I chose the Dewey Decimal Rap because it's a classic. I liked this week's homework because embedded media looks a lot complicated to include than it actually is. Divs, id's, and classes also make a lot more sense to me than last week.
