### Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

All of HTML was new to me except for some knowledge about the index.html file. I thought the relationship between the head and body elements was interesting. I was also amazed at the capacities of HTML5. I was sure that forms and embedded media would have to be handled by JavaScript, but HTML can manage them in a straightforward way. That said, forms were the most difficult for me to learn. I know how to include them now, but I still don't fully understand how they work.

### Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I'm excited to make websites that look more professional. My goal is to be able to make a website from the backend that looks as good as Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace, etc. Hopefully we will learn what looks good in CSS because I'm a little anxious about attempting to do that on my own. I'm excited to see different style options.

### Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

Is instructions for instant oatmeal a cop-out? I do eat a lot of it. I was going to make an instructable on knitting, but knitting is already hard enough to teach in person. Anyway, I was making it for breakfast two mornings ago and decided to take some pictures of it in case I couldn't think of anything. I don't regret it-- oatmeal is a good look for an HTML website.

Anyway, in terms of constructing the site, I looked at the class work a lot and did a lot of copying and pasting. Monitoring how my progress looks in my browser has also become a big part of my work flow.
