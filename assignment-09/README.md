### Briefly describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal selectors are indicated by the "*" asterisk symbol. This applies the style to the entire html document. An element selector styles all elements that use the tag. Selecting "h1" will style all h1 elements in the html document. A class selector is manually applied to chosen tags in the html document. A class is like a group. It is indicated by a period then the name you chose (".example"). It will apply the style to all elements that have the class assigned to it. The id selector is similar to the class selector, except it can only be applied to one element. It is indicated by a hashtag then the name you choose ("#example").

### Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes

My color palette was "white", "black", and "orange". The images have black backgrounds with colorful graphics in the middle. They're from one of my favorite '60's movies, "Charade". I chose black as my background because it merges with the background color of the images. This makes the color palette in the images the main color palette of the website.

### Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I made the html site first. Then I started making a corresponding style sheet. This was frustrating for me because it took a long time before I found something that worked. I found that I had more selectors than I needed and that was throwing me off. I had to start over on it multiple times.
