### Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client was Kruzof Candle Company-- a candle business I wanted to drop out and start my freshman year of college. Here are the company's needs:

"My company's name is Kruzof Candle Company and we make hand-poured Southeast Alaskan candles. Our brand colors are forest green and white. The two words to describe the theme of the website are wild and comfortable."

### What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

"Display: block" makes elements display on the screen vertically. "Display: inline" makes elements display on the screen horizontally. "Display: inline-block" makes elements display on the screen horizontally with space between them.

### Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

First, I spent a solid 5 hours working on the nav bar. But everything we've been learning this semester clicked in my head when I was working on it which was very nice. It also felt so good when I finally got it functioning and looking good. Then I added the body text on each page. Lastly, I added the banner images.
