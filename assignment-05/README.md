### How many document head and body elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

The head and body elements can only be used once on a page. They are essential to the structure of an HTML document. The head element contains information about the webpage that is seperate from the webpage content. This can control the title, description, language, and more. The body element includes the content of the webpage. What's included in the body element is visible on the webpage.

### Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural markup provides information about the structure of a website's content. This includes headers, paragraphs, lists, and line breaks. Semantic markup alters certain words and phrases in the content, such as making words appear bold or italic.

### Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

There were a lot of new elements to include for this assignment. I didn't have them memorized so I used a lot of copy and paste. Sometimes I would type them so I could work on commiting the tags to memory.
As far a HTML etiquette goes, should you press Return at any time to make your code more readable? I used it a couple of times.
