### Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

I used GitHub, version control, and repositories for my Creative Coding class, but I didn't know it was the same process for web development. It clicked in my brain this semester how and why it works.

### Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

I thought the relationship between html and css was interesting. Since you start by making html and organizing it by divs, the styling is more logical because it is consistent with the divs. It made it easier to make cohesive designs.

### Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

Though this was during the heat of finals week, I enjoyed this project a lot because it was directly applicable to my life. Right now, I have a Wordpress portfolio of my work. Since I made this from scratch it was a rewarding experience to see my own site turn out just as good as my Wordpress site. I don't have to post about my projects on wordpress anymore... I can post about my handmade web projects on my *handmade* website-- I have more accredibility.

Knowing this, I copied and pasted snipets of previous code with more excitement than usual. I also just took the images from my Wordpress and uploaded them to this site. I plan to work on this over the summer to learn more about web developement and make something I think is really cool. I have a good start now.

It has been a fun semester.
