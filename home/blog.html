      <h2>Finals Week</h2>
      <h3>April 29, 2019</h3>
      <p>Hello! Finals Week has come around at the University of Montana, which means I'm finishing up my sophomore year of college. This semester I took Intro to Web Design, Photoshop: Art and Design, Ilustrator: Vector Design and Layout, Intro to Ethics, and Parks and Outdoor Recreation Management. I will be heading back to Sitka for the summer. It will be good to be home, but I'll also miss all my Missoula adventures. Today I packed up the majority of my belongings, got my ulock unjammed, filled up my bike tires, and worked on this website for few hours while sitting with my friends Allyson and Holly. It's also my brother's birthday today.

      <h2>New Blog</h2>
      <h3>April 29, 2019</h3>
      <p>Recent events have issued the need for a blog. This will mostly just be a way to keep up with my web design over the summer.</p>
